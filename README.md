Using Random Forest and XGBoosting to predict winners in soccer games in Brazillian Soccer League

# Predicting Winners in the Brazilian Soccer League

## Overview
The Brazilian soccer league stands out as one of the most fiercely contested and unpredictable leagues globally. Its unpredictability stems from various factors: a high volume of games in a single season, multiple concurrent competitions, a congested match calendar, highly competitive players, and teams spread across diverse geographic locations within the country. This project aims to delve into this unpredictability by forecasting match winners within this dynamic league.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a predictive model for determining match winners in the Brazilian soccer league. Data was sourced from fbref, comprising a rich dataset encompassing variables like 'date', 'time', 'comp', 'round', 'day', 'venue', 'result', 'gf', 'ga', 'opponent', 'xg', 'xga', 'poss', 'attendance', 'captain', 'formation', 'referee', 'match report', 'notes', 'sh', 'sot', 'dist', 'fk', 'pk', 'pkatt', 'season', 'team'.

## Methodology and Results
The predictive model employed various techniques, notably feature engineering, to enhance its predictive power. Leveraging the random forest algorithm, the model achieved an impressive precision rate of 82%. This success underscores the model's capability to forecast match outcomes within the Brazilian league with a high degree of accuracy.

## Detailed Approach
1. **Data Collection**: Scraping data from fbref to gather match-specific details like scores, team performances, referee information, venue specifics, and more.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Crafting new features from the existing dataset to improve the model's ability to discern patterns and make accurate predictions.
3. **Model Building**: Utilizing the random forest algorithm due to its efficacy in handling complex datasets and achieving high prediction accuracy.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure its reliability.

## Insights and Implications
The success of this predictive model provides valuable insights not only for soccer enthusiasts but also for stakeholders and analysts within the sports domain. Understanding and predicting match outcomes in such a highly competitive league can aid in strategic decision-making for teams, betting predictions, and fan engagement.

## Future Enhancements
To further improve the predictive model:
- Experiment with other advanced machine learning algorithms for comparison.
- Enhance feature engineering by incorporating more relevant variables or data.
- Consider real-time data integration to adapt to ongoing changes during the league season.

This project serves as a comprehensive exploration into the realm of sports analytics, employing data-driven methodologies to forecast winners in the enthralling and challenging landscape of the Brazilian soccer league.
